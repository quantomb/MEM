This subdirectory contains most of the codes needed to analytically
continue the binned QMC data generated by the 2D_HUBBARD_DCA codes
and likely other modules.  These codes are run by the scripts in 
the run_scripts module.  The codes are listed and briefly described:
___________
2default.f: This code uses the coarse-grained single-particle spectra 
(Abar(K,w)) to construct default models for the two-particle spectra in 
a random phase approximation.
______________
dsigcluster.f: This code use the coarse-grained spectra Abar(K,w) to
calculate the coarse-grained Gbar(K,w).  It then inverts the coarse
graining equation

     Gbar(K,w) = SUM_kt G(K+kt,w)
     
using a root finder to extract the self energy Sigma(K,w).
_________________
energy_surface.f: This code calculates the zero energy surface.  It is
not yet modernized.
________________
module_Global.f: Contains the global declarations.
__________
rddcams.f: This code reads the binned data (bin#.dat), qualifies the data,
coarse-grains it, calculates its covariance. etc.  It properly takes into 
account the minus sign problem.
_________________
readmc_linuxms.f: This code takes the coarse-grained data and its covariance,
generates the kernel, diagonalizes the covariance and then rotates the
data and the kernel into the frame in which the covariance is diagonal.
___________
sopt_dca.f:  This code calculates default models for the coarse-grained
single -article spectra using second order perturbation theory.
_______________
spectra_star.f: This code interpolates the self energy Sigma(K,w) and
calculates A(k,w) along different directions in the BZ.  
_________
tables.f: Betts tables.  Contains symmetry operations.
