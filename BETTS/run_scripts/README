These scripts run the spectral analysis tools for the 2D_HUBBARD_DCA data.
Below, I will describe what each script does.  However, generally,

SP: means single-particle
TP: means two-particle
list: takes runs from a run list, which you must create.
all: takes a series of command-line inputs.
nD: a scipt that specializes in n dimensional data.

_________
mem_locs:  Put this file in your home directory.  It contains the locations
of these scripts, the bryan code, and the Betts spectral analysis codes.
You will have to modify it accordingly.
_______
run_all:  These scripts run an uninterupted sequence of data.
________
run_list:  These scripts run a sequence of data indexed in a list file.
For the file format, read the comments at the top of each script.
